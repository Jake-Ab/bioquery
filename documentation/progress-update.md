# BioQuery Progress Summary — 3 Oct 2025

## Recent Accomplishments

- Delivered a data-driven dashboard shell: Supabase-authenticated routes now wrap the Discover and Collections pages, with the chat provider managing session-specific conversations, message history, and starred status.
- Replaced mock sidebar data with live Supabase content, added a collapsible (animated) layout toggle, and refreshed the “New Chat” entry points with the writing icon for clearer affordance.
- Upgraded the Discover experience: chat titles support rename and starring without cluttering the heading, attachment chips feed through the composer, and messages maintain scroll position with normalized metadata (including `attached_files`).
- Hardened the chat services layer so `is_starred` persists in the core `chats` table and message payloads gracefully handle attachment arrays, preparing the UI for Supabase migrations.
- Introduced consistent design refinements (alignment fixes, accessible labels, responsive spacing) across the sidebar and composer so the UI matches the aesthetic captured in `documentation/bioquery_design_plan.md`.

## In-Flight & Next Steps

- **Sprint 2 priorities (per `documentation/bioquery_execution_plan.md`)**
  - Connect the Discover composer to Supabase RPC/Edge Functions so messages and attachments persist beyond the client session.
  - Implement chats/messages SQL migrations (including `is_starred` and `attached_files`) and verify round-trip CRUD flows from the new ChatProvider helpers.
  - Begin wiring artifact creation and retrieval so the Collections view reflects saved outputs from conversations.
- **Upcoming Sprint 3 preparation**
  - Define the graph/visualization data contracts in `src/types` ahead of the Explore page work.
  - Scope UI motion polish using Framer Motion once live data flows are stable, prioritizing chat-to-artifact transitions.
- **Operational follow-ups**
  - Finalize Supabase environment variables for local + staging builds, and document the workflow in `documentation/important/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` alongside chat service usage notes.
  - Draft integration tests that cover the new sidebar behaviors and chat composer interactions to keep regressions out as RAG integration starts.

## Risks & Support Needed

- Attachment handling currently tracks filenames only; Supabase storage requirements (bucket naming, access policies) need confirmation before binary uploads land.
- Edge Function APIs for search and summarization are still mocked—coordinate with the Gemini integration workstream so we can align payload shapes early and avoid rework.

## Immediate Action Items

1. Run the pending SQL migration for `is_starred` and `attached_files`, then smoke-test chat creation/star toggling end-to-end.
2. Wire the Discover composer to the planned message creation endpoint (or a temporary RPC) so we can validate the chat provider against the real database.
3. Kick off artifact persistence stories, ensuring the Collections page consumes Supabase data rather than placeholders.
4. Schedule a design sync to confirm the refreshed layout meets branding expectations before expanding to Explore/Visualization features.
