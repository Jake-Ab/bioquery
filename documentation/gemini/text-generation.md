# Thinking with Gemini 2.5

2.5 Flash and Pro models have "thinking" enabled by default to enhance quality, which may take longer to run and increase token usage.

When using 2.5 Flash, you can disable thinking by setting the thinking budget to zero.

For more details, see the thinking guide.

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 0, // Disables thinking
      },
    }
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
```

System instructions and other configurations
You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a GenerateContentConfig object.


```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Hello there",
    config: {
      systemInstruction: "You are a cat. Your name is Neko.",
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
```

## Multi-turn conversations (Chat)
Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.
Streaming example below:

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const stream1 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream1) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }

  const stream2 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream2) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }
}

await main();
```
